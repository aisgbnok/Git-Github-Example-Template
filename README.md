## Exercise

Let's do a few simple exercises to provide a basic understanding of Git & GitHub.

### 0. Copy this Repository

This repository is a template repository, so first we need to make a copy on your account.

1. Click the `Use this template` button on the repo's GitHub homepage
   or [navigate to this link.](https://github.com/aisgbnok/Git-Github-Example-Template/generate)
    - This will duplicate the repo but keep all the files.
    - This repo is owned by `aisgbnok/Git-Github-Example-Template`
    - The new repo is owned by `<your GitHub username>/<repo name> `
2. Choose a `repository name` for this duplicate
3. You can ensure only you have access to the repo by making it private, or you can keep it public
   where anyone can see this on your GitHub profile.
4. Create the new repository from the template.

Now that you have generated a new repository we can clone it to your local machine. Remember Git is
a distributed version control system, meaning you need to have a local copy of the repository on
your machine to make edits. (You can make some basic edits in GitHub, but most of your coding will
be done locally.)

### 1. Change your `README`

Let's start with something simple. This README.md is a markdown file. Markdown files are text files
with some basic formatting abilities. Markdown files have a `.md` file extension and are widely used
by developers for documentation. (Like having a README file explaining what their repository does.)

Let's clean up this repository now that it is yours!

1. Start by removing all of section `0. Copy this Repository` until you get to
   section `1. Change your README`

> Make a commit.

### 2. Add another Markdown File
Add another markdown file and make a commit.
