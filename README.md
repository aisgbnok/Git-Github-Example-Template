## Exercise

Let's do a few simple exercises to provide a basic understanding of Git & GitHub.

### 0. Copy this Repository

This repository is a template repository, so first we need to make a copy on your account.

1. Click the `Use this template` button on the repo's GitHub homepage
   or [navigate to this link.](https://github.com/aisgbnok/Git-Github-Example-Template/generate)
    - This will duplicate the repo but keep all the files.
    - This repo is owned by `aisgbnok/Git-Github-Example-Template`
    - The new repo is owned by `<your GitHub username>/<repo name> `
2. Choose a `repository name` for this duplicate
3. You can ensure only you have access to the repo by making it private, or you can keep it public
   where anyone can see this on your GitHub profile.
4. Create the new repository from the template.

Now that you have generated a new repository we can clone it to your local machine. Remember Git is
a distributed version control system, meaning you need to have a local copy of the repository on
your machine to make edits. (You can make some basic edits in GitHub, but most of your coding will
be done locally.)
